r"""The decisions file the report downloads and `review` writes; `clean` reads it.

```json
{"version": 1, "report": "20260926-171446-audit", "roots": ["C:\\Photos"],
 "pairs": [{"kept_in": "C:\\Photos\\2019", "removed_from": "D:\\Old",
            "action": "swap"}],
 "bursts": [{"kept": ["C:\\Photos\\IMG_1.jpg"],
             "discarded": ["C:\\Photos\\IMG_2.jpg"]}]}
```

Paths are host paths, as the report shows them. `roots` are the folders analysed by the
audit behind the decisions: `clean` refuses the file when it sees other folders. Pairs
left as planned and burst series left whole are not listed.
