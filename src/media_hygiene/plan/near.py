"""Near duplicates: one picture saved again at another size, quality or without EXIF.

Two images are near duplicates only when every test agrees: both 64-bit hashes differ
by at most `NEAR_DISTANCE` bits, the aspect ratio is the same (±1 %), and the smaller
one was shot at the same moment or has lost its date. A burst (another moment) never
qualifies.
Featureless images (black, white, blank) are left out: they all hash alike.

Candidates meet through multi-index hashing: two hashes at most 3 bits apart share at
least one of their four 16-bit quarters, so only images sharing a quarter are compared.
