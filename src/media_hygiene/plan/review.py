"""Apply a review's decisions (report controls, `media-hygiene review`) to the plan.

A folder pair holds the copies deleted from `removed_from` because an identical file is
kept in `kept_in`. A review can swap a pair (keep the copies of `removed_from`, delete
the one of `kept_in`) or skip it (delete nothing of the pair). Several decisions may
touch one group: a copy some decision keeps is never deleted. The shots of a burst
series a review set aside are moved to the quarantine.
