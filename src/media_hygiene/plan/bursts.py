"""Burst series: shots of one camera, seconds apart, of the same scene.

A burst is curation, not duplication: two shots may be great and eight blurry. Series
are listed, the sharpest shot suggested; a plain `clean` never touches them. Only the
shots set aside in `media-hygiene review` are moved, by `clean --decisions`.

Time comes first: shots are sorted by camera and moment, and each one is compared only
with the shots taken up to `BURST_GAP_SECONDS` later, which keeps the comparisons few.
